<p>The human body has many internal organs that work together to <span class="highlight">keep us alive and healthy</span>. Each organ has a specific function, and they form different systems, such as the digestive, circulatory, and endocrine systems.</p>

<p>Digestion begins in the <span class="highlight">mouth</span>, where food is chewed and mixed with <span class="highlight">saliva contains enzymes</span> that start <span class="highlight">to break down</span> carbohydrates. When we <span class="highlight">to swallow food</span>, food passes through the pharynx, which connects the mouth to the esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular tube that moves food to the stomach through <span class="highlight">a process called peristalsis</span>, a series of wave-like contractions.</p>

<p>The stomach is a muscular organ that mixes food with gastric juices, which contain acid and enzymes to <span class="highlight">to break down proteins</span>. From the stomach, food enters the small intestine, where most digestion and nutrient absorption take place. The walls of the small intestine have tiny structures called <span class="highlight">villus</span>, which <span class="highlight">help absorb nutrients</span> into the bloodstream.</p>

<p>The remaining food moves into the large intestine, where water and minerals are absorbed. The remaining waste is formed into feces and stored in the rectum until it is <span class="highlight">to be eliminated through the anus</span>.</p>

<p>The liver is one of the most important organs in the body. It produces bile, a substance that helps digest fats. The liver also filters toxins from the blood, stores vitamins and minerals, and helps regulate metabolism.</p>

<p>The gallbladder <span class="highlight">stores bile</span> and releases it into the small intestine when fat is present in food. Without bile, the body would have difficulty digesting fatty foods.</p>

<p>The pancreas plays two major roles. First, it produces digestive enzymes that help <span class="highlight">to break down proteins</span>, carbohydrates, and fats in the small intestine. Second, it produces insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, it can lead to diabetes.</p>

<p>These organs work together to support digestion, metabolism, and overall health. Problems with any of these organs can affect the entire body. Understanding their functions helps medical professionals diagnose and treat diseases effectively.</p>
